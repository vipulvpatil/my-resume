  description: >
    Based in Bengaluru ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, I am a Software Engineering specializing in Distributed systems. My last role was with Coinbase spearheading the backend efforts on <a target='_blank' href='https://commerce.coinbase.com/'>Coinbase Commerce</a>.<br>I have a diverse programming history having started my journey as a Flash Game Programmer in 2008. Before I reached my current destination of Backend programming in Go, I visited multiple stops like iOS Programmer (2013) and Fullstack Engineer (2016). As a Senior Software Engineer, my programming ideology is guided by three basic principles, readability, maintanability and extensibility.
